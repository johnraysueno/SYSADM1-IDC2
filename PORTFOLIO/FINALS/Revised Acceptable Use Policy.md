    appeal and the circumstances surrounding the violation. This review
    will be conducted within 5 business days of receiving the appeal.

3.  **Decision:** After reviewing the appeal, the user will be informed

    be adjusted or removed. If the appeal is denied, the original
    penalty will stand.

**POLICIES:**

1\. The rental period of each technology device is one month. If the
technology device is not returned on or before the end, an additional
late fee is applied. For every week that exceeds the rental period, a
late fee of ₱500 per week is applied. For example, if a student rents a
laptop for 1 month but returns it 2 weeks late from the date, there
would be a late fee of ₱1,000 because those extra weeks cost ₱500 a
week. If an educator rents a tablet for 1 month but returns it 3 weeks
late, he or she would be charged an extra ₱1,500 because there is an
additional fee of ₱500 per week for 3 weeks.

2\. All rented devices must be well cared for by the clients and
maintained in good condition and only utilized for educational purposes.
Damaged, lost, or stolen device costs additional fees. Cuts or dents,
minor damages will be charged ₱1,000 - ₱3,000 while moderate damage
which is screen broken or other hardware malfunction, fees range from
₱3,000 - ₱5,000. In cases wherein the damage is not recoverable, for
example in cases of water damages or unrecoverable damage, replacement
cost is justified in order to pay for it; depending on the device it
ranges between ₱10,000 to ₱50,000. In case that a lost or stolen phone
occurred, the customer will be shouldered the full replacement cost.
However, if preventive measures like using protective case and
preventing the devices to come close to liquids as well as being exposed
to extreme conditions were done, customers won\'t have to suffer those
additional charges. All damages must be reported immediately to
TechLease so as not to exacerbate any problem. Any damage, loss, or
theft will be returned and paid by the customer for any repairs or
replacements during their lease period.

3\. Customers are allowed to rent a maximum of three devices at a time.
This policy is in place to ensure that all customers have access to the
technology they need, while maintaining fair availability of devices
across our rental pool. If a customer wishes to rent additional devices,
they must return one or more of their current rentals before renting new
ones.

4\. Downloading and installing applications that may harm the rented
technology, such as those that contain malware, corrupt files, or
harmful viruses, is strictly prohibited. Customers should only install
apps that are necessary for academic use and must ensure that these
applications come from trusted sources, such as official app stores
(Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or approved educational platforms).
Unauthorized or third-party apps that may compromise device security,
such as file-sharing programs, unverified game downloads, or apps that
interfere with the device's functionality, are not allowed. TechLease
recommends using only essential, educational apps to ensure the safety
and proper functioning of the rented devices.

5\. Before returning any rented devices, customers are required to
delete all personal files, including documents, images, PowerPoint
presentations, videos, and any other stored data. Additionally, all
social media accounts and personal profiles must be logged out, and no
personal credentials (such as social media accounts or email login
information) should be saved on the device. Customers must ensure that
all downloaded files, applications, and browser history are completely
removed to protect their privacy and security. Failure to follow these
guidelines may result in an additional cleaning fee of ₱1,000 to ₱3,000,
depending on the extent of the data removal required, or other penalties
as deemed necessary by TechLease.
